# TheOases
The ultimate goal of The Oases is to provide...
a self-owned platform to self create/manage users' own "virtual spaces" which FOREVER is THEIRS yet fully networked as a part of the global "metaverse" (the oases).

Therefore the core system of the Oases follows principles such as 
1.  must be fully open source. (MIT)
2.  must be fully standalone as a platform. The functionality must not depend on any other closed platforms.
3.  must be completely free of charge. Must not depend on closed/paid software. (MIT or MIT equivalent)
4.  must support networking among its instances to share data and ensure the integrity (Block Chain)
5.  must safefully support modules to extend features/database
6.  itself must be smart enough to ensure security vulnerability (AI managed platform)
7.  help other critical dependent open source projects (such as glTF related)
8.  help to define open standards 

- The definition of "Virtual Space"
"Virtual Space" can be based on text/2d/3d/VR/AR or any media that human can communicate based on.
(In fact that we consider mastodon repository as a good starting point to fork or even build as a module of mastodon)
